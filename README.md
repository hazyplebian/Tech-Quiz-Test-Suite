## Description
This Tech Quiz Test Suite project enhances a fully functioning MERN-stack Tech Quiz application by adding comprehensive testing coverage using **Cypress**. In todayâ€™s dynamic development environment, testing is a critical part of the workflow that ensures reliability, robustness, and a seamless user experience under various conditions.

**Tech Quiz Test Suite** features:
- **Cypress Configuration:** Set up for both component and end-to-end (E2E) testing.
- **Component Tests:** Verify isolated quiz component behavior.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate real user interactions, from starting a quiz to viewing and restarting results.
- **MERN Stack Foundation:** React frontend, Node.js/Express API, MongoDB database.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! To propose improvements or fixes:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).

## Tests

This project uses **Cypress** for automated testing:

* **Component Tests:** Located in `cypress/component/quiz.spec.js`, these verify that the Quiz component renders questions, handles answer selection, and resets correctly.
* **E2E Tests:** Located in `cypress/e2e/quiz.cy.js`, these simulate a user flow: starting the quiz, answering ten random questions, viewing the final score, and restarting the quiz.

**To add or update tests:**

1. Write specs in the appropriate `cypress/` subdirectory.
2. Run `npx cypress open` to validate interactively.
3. Commit your new or updated spec files and submit a PR.
